pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
head(pdbstats)
```
Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.
```{r}
n.xray <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", pdbstats$X.ray)))
n.em <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", pdbstats$EM)))
n.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", pdbstats$Total)))

p.xray <- 100* n.xray/n.total
p.em <- (n.em/n.total)*100

round(p.xray, 2)
round(p.em, 2)
```

Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
